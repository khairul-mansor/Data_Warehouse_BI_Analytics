## Design a Data Warehouse

The solid waste management company has provied the sample data they wish to collect.

I started my project by designing a Star Schema warehouse by identifying the columns for the various dimension and fact tables in the schema.

### Design the dimension table MyDimDate

Write down the fields in the MyDimDate table in text editor one field per line. The company is looking at a granularity of day. Which means they would like to have the ability to generate the report on yearly, monthly, daily, and weekday basis.

Here is a partial list of fields to serve as an example:

    dateid
    month
    monthname
    ...
    ...

DATEID
DATE
YEAR
QUARTER
QUARTERNAME
MONTH
MONTHNAME
DAY
WEEKDAY
WEEKDAYNAME


### Design the dimension table MyDimWaste

Write down the fields in the MyDimWaste table in text editor one field per line.

### Design the dimension table MyDimZone
